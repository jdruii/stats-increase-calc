# [Stat Increase Calculator for Top Heroes](https://th-statsincreasecalc.streamlit.app/)
Ever wondered if getting the Cloud Castle skin is really better than getting the Tower of Chaos skin for your Horde queue? Well, this is the right tool for you. See how stat increases from stuffs affects your heroes!

## How it works: 
* Input the current stats of your hero. To see these stats, go to your hero screen -> click a specific hero -> click the (i) beside its stats.
* Make sure that the calculated total matches the total values in your hero screen.
* Input the stats given by stuffs like castle skin, hero skin, troop skin, decor, tech research, etc.
* See how much actual stats you gain.
* (Optional) Compare two different source of stat increase and see which one gives you a bigger increase.

Note: The default values are my Wukong's stats at the time of making this. Your hero's stats should look more or less the same. 

## Planned Feature:
* Adding the stats of castle skins to lessen the amount of manual inputs needed.
* Adding gear stats (huge maybe).
